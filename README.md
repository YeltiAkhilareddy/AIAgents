**üß† AI-Powered Ticketing & Smart Data Processing ‚Äì Project Documentation**
**üìå Project Overview**

The AI-Powered Ticketing & Smart Data Processing project is designed to automate ticket management, customer queries, and compliance checks using a combination of LLMs (OpenAI, Groq LLaMA 3, Azure OpenAI) and Python-based backend automation. The system is built as a Django REST Framework API, supporting intelligent ticket assignment, SLA monitoring, and domain-specific processing of structured data (Excel/CSV) from S3.

Unlike traditional rule-based ticketing systems, this project leverages AI for:

Understanding user queries

Suggesting ticket assignments

Processing domain-specific data like pharma serial tracking and compliance issues

Generating AI-assisted responses for internal teams

The modular architecture ensures maintainability, scalability, and future enhancements like UI integration or multi-LLM orchestration.

**üéØ Project Goals**

Fully automated ticket handling and assignment using AI

Intelligent processing of structured files from S3

SLA breach notifications and proactive issue monitoring

Flexibility to plug in multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Groq LLaMA, Azure)

Transparent logging of AI and backend operations

Modular, maintainable backend structure

**üß± System Architecture**

The system follows a modular flow:

API & Routing Layer: Handles REST endpoints for tickets, categories, modules, teams, and AI responses.

Data & Ticket Models: Django models for tickets, assignments, teams, modules, and categories.

LLM Layer: Communicates with OpenAI, Groq, or Azure APIs to:

Generate AI responses

Suggest ticket assignments

Process compliance or industry-specific data

Processing Layer: Handles:

Ticket creation, patching, and retrieval

File-based workflows (Excel/CSV from S3)

Serial number tracking and validation

SLA notifications

Utils & Helpers: Encapsulates file handling, AI prompts, cleaning logic, and response post-processing.

Logging & Audit: Tracks changes, AI decisions, and ticket assignments for traceability.

**üîÑ Core Workflows**
1. Ticket Management

Create Ticket: Users or AI can create tickets linked to modules, projects, and categories.

Update Ticket: Status, assignment, or content updates are tracked and logged.

Assign Ticket: AI selects the most suitable team based on ticket content.

Retrieve Tickets: Single or bulk retrieval with nested assignment info.

2. AI Response Handling

Users can query AI to get responses for tickets, including suggested actions or solution previews.

Chat history is maintained per user for future reference.

AI responses are logged in ChatConvo for audit and traceability.

3. File-Based Processing

Pharma Serial Tracking: Users upload Excel files from S3, and AI helps track serial numbers.

Compliance Check: AI extracts and analyzes structured data to generate compliance insights.

Files are processed with validation checks and AI-guided extraction.

4. SLA & Proactive Monitoring

SLA breaches trigger notifications via automated background processes.

Proactive issues from SAP OData are fetched, cleaned, and reported to stakeholders.

**ü§ñ Why Use LLMs Here?**

LLMs provide:

Semantic understanding of ticket content

Context-aware assignment to teams

Intelligent responses for user queries

Data interpretation in Excel/S3 files for domain-specific agents (compliance, pharma)

Proactive suggestions for workflow optimization

This allows the system to act as a smart AI assistant for ticketing and domain workflows.

**üìÅ Project Components**
Component	Description
Routes (urls.py)	REST API endpoints for tickets, modules, teams, categories, AI responses
Views (views.py)	Core API logic, AI integration, file processing, ticket patching and assignment
Models (models.py)	Database models: Ticket, TicketAssignment, Team, Module, Category, ChatConvo
Serializers	Validation and transformation of data between models and API responses
Utils (utils.py)	Helper functions for AI prompts, Excel handling, S3 access, serial tracking
S3 Integration	File upload/download and presigned URLs
AI/LLM Layer	Handles OpenAI/Groq/Azure calls for responses, assignments, and analysis

**üîå LLM Compatibility**

OpenAI ‚Äì GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 for general ticketing responses and compliance insights

Groq LLaMA 3 ‚Äì High-speed, open-weight LLM for domain-specific tasks

Azure OpenAI ‚Äì Secure enterprise-ready integration

LLM choice is abstracted in utils and configurable via environment variables, enabling easy switching or ensemble strategies.

**üîç Example Use Case**

A user submits a ticket regarding a pharma shipment discrepancy.

AI analyzes the ticket content and suggests the appropriate team for assignment.

Serial tracking files are fetched from S3, validated, and processed using AI to locate the problematic serial numbers.

Compliance agent reads uploaded Excel sheets, extracts data, and generates AI-guided insights.

SLA monitoring detects potential breaches and sends proactive notifications.

User receives ticket updates, AI responses, and relevant data insights automatically.
