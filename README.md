**🧠 AI-Powered Ticketing & Smart Data Processing – Project Documentation**
The AI-Powered Ticketing System is designed to streamline IT service and customer support operations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify, analyze, and auto-resolve tickets.
This system integrates Django as the backend framework with GPT-4.0-mini (or similar) to automate ticket triaging, generate resolutions, and assist support agents with knowledge-based insights.

🧠 Key Features

🔹 AI-Powered Ticket Classification – Automatically identifies the ticket type and category using LLM-based text analysis.

🔹 Smart Resolution Suggestions – Suggests potential fixes or relevant KB articles using GPT-powered reasoning.

🔹 Context-Aware Response Generation – Generates user-friendly and technically accurate responses.

🔹 Integrated Knowledge Base – Optionally connects to internal documentation or database to enhance LLM responses.

🔹 Django REST API Ready – Provides structured APIs to handle ticket creation, updates, and AI interactions.

🔹 Extensible & Modular – Easy to integrate with existing service desks (like SAP, CSA, or custom ticketing portals).

🚀 Usage Flow

A user submits a new ticket via frontend or API.

The backend captures the ticket description and metadata.

The AI module (ai_handler.py) sends the text to GPT-4.0-mini for:

Classification (category, urgency, department)

Suggested resolution or next steps

The AI response is stored and displayed in the dashboard.

Agents can review, edit, or auto-close tickets based on confidence scores.

🧪 Example API Request

POST /api/tickets/analyze/

{
  "ticket_id": "TCK12345",

}


Response

{
  "category": "SAP - Authentication",
  "priority": "High",
  "suggested_resolution": "Renew the user’s certificate using SAP Logon Pad configuration.",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
